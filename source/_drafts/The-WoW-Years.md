I started my journey with technology and video games at a young age, as many do. For as long as I can remember I have always played video games and tinkered with technology. Even to this day there is nothing that fills me with glee more than a new peice of interesting technology to play around with. I'm fairly certain that I am not the only person with a story like this.



I started my journey with video games at a young age as many do. This interest sparked a general interest in technology as a whole and from a young age I was always tinkering. I am sure that many technology minded people or people in the "Let's Play" community will have somewhat similar stories as I have heard more than a few.

So at a young age I mostly played what we now call classic video games. Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Sega, PS1, PS2, N64, Game body,  and anything else in those eras included. My favorite game did not come from a console, it came from a game that many of you will have undoubtedly played; World of Warcraft.

I started my journey's in Azeroth around the age of 12 on one of the worst laptops imaginable. The first expansion was just released when I started and I enjoyed every moment of play time that I got. In fact I would eventually sneak more play time at night long after I should have been in bed with the covers over my head and a scorching hot laptop on my legs.

As I got better at the game I took on the role of a tank warrior on the Alliance as a human. At first I was probably terrible and being a tank at the time was extremely difficult for the warrior class that I played. Eventually I farmed up enough gear and skill to try my hand at raiding. Raiding would set me on the path that I am on to this very day.

I was the main tank for a small guild on a small server and I was good and prepared, but most other people in the guild were not. This meant that I was the 13-15 year old that knew what was going on while everyone else was clueless. At first it was hard to win over everyone in the guild, as people seem to be naturally opposed to a "child" running their in-game dungeon raids.

This lead to me hopping from one guild to another until I finally decided to run my own guild and recruit anyone I knew was good. People that cared about age be damned. With my guild behind me we cleared most of the content from the expansion up to sunwell when life got a bit tougher for me, and I had to quit World of Warcraft. High school is the worstâ€¦

I could not be kept away long though, and my interests in the game soon bled over to my younger brother. Rather than do the same thing that I had done many times before, I decided to switch it up. I was to play a Tauren Restoration (Healer) Druid on the horde this time around. I would build my empire again and we would conquer all of the content.

This never really happened, maybe the server was just lacking good players, or maybe the good players were already accounted for in other guilds. Looking back now I knew it was the latter. Quick side note: the server that I played on was filled with some of the most offensive miscreants that I have ever met, this probably had some effect on my brother and I. There was also an add-on in use that was highly against the TOS called babel, that let the horde and alliance factions offend each other through chat. (Normally the Horde and the Alliance could not talk to one another)

With the knowledge that I would never be able to start my own guild I opted to join a big raiding guild on the server. This is where I would find many life long friends that I am still in contact with today. We would raid or play the game together nearly every night of the week.

For me it seems like World of Warcraft was an escape from the reality that was my home life. The friends that I used to have in middle school were gone and I struggled to make more. My family was constantly growing as my mom had three more kids while I was in high school and in order to put food on the table she took a job. I was tasked with watching the kids and babysitting.

As I moved away from home to go to college my love for the game never decreased, but my playtime did.
