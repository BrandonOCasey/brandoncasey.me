## College

I quickly learned in college that I had a leg up on game development. I had spent a lot of time tinkering with computers and I though I knew how they worked. It turned out that I still had a lot to learn, most of it would not be from school. The one lesson that really drove home, was that game developers had to take low paying jobs with long hours. This sounded terrible to me. Not to mention the fact that game development is highly technical work that should land you a lot of money.

With that knowledge I knew that I should finish my degree in Game Programming, but that I would never work in that field.
